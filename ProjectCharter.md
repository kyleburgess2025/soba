# soba project charter

**project name:** soba (stress obliterating board applications/the word for room in Croatian)

**problem statement:** soba is a tool for college students struggling with housing options for their upcoming semesters. we roll out the project targeting students and administration at vanderbilt university â€“ hoping to improve student access to housing knowledge and limiting efforts required in the housing office in dealing with student issues. 

**purpose:** soba is a social and administrative platform that attempts to match students with potential dormitories and roommates. it uses current (and potentially past) housing statistics to determine whether a group of students potentially has access to a housing option through a percentage based-system, shows the amenities accessible to them in their room and common spaces, and allows them to view current and past resident reviews about specific locations on campus. 

**users:** in the initial phase of soba, our user group is two-fold: the administration and student population at vanderbilt. our goal in the long-term is to seek out partnerships at other universities. 

**scenarios:** for administration, our main goal is for them to corroborate the available housing options and their specific amenities based on newly constructed and phased-out units, as well as provide statistics on the number of available beds (currently given to students in a pdf document). administrators will have the soba team set up their account within the portal, using their unique credentials to avoid student access to resources. for our students, we want to provide a login with google (since most universities have access to it as a resource) and then lead them to a home screen. we want students to be able to provide their potential roommates, their current point totals going into the housing lottery, and any amenities they believe are nice or necessary in their new living space. we do all the work for them and figure out what's possible, and they can reevaluate and avoid sad feelings (and angry emails flooding housing staff inboxes) later

**team:** we have been brought onto this project because we believe a student perspective is necessary to improve transparency around the housing process at vanderbilt, and allow other students to experience less headache and heartbreak around housing allocations and decisions. our current teams consists of:

**julian: backend dev**

**kyle: frontend dev**

**austin: ui/ux designer**

**kari: product manager**



**high level requirements:**: functional student and admin modes with appropriate restrictions, access to student review platform, ability for students to match into roommate groups, view of possible dorms, view of amenities, chance calculators for amenity selection  

**platform features:** login with google using firebase authentication, database using mongoDB with python, mobile-first front-end built with react. 

**bring to market:** we bring to market a way to keep student morale high in a currently flawed housing system, find additional ways to increase housing administration productivity,
