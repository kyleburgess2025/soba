Vanderbilt University believes in the value of a residential requirement and utilizes a seniority-driven, point-based lottery process to allocate residential assignments. 
Generally, you gain a point with each successive year (e.g., freshmen have 1 point, sophomores have 2 points, etc.)

There are a variety of housing options available on campus, including singles, doubles, apartment style doubles/triples/quads, and 4-person/6-person suites. When applying as a group, your group average is used throughout the housing lottery. 

This introduces a level of uncertainty for students, as they never really know which rooms are reasonable to apply for. This year in particular, a decrease in approval to live off-campus resulted in a shortage of beds, leaving many students unsure of their housing plans for the 2022-2023 academic school year. 

This project attempts to bring some transparency to the housing process...[idk more words Kari you got this!]
