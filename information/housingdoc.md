Vanderbilt University believes in the value of a residential requirement and utilizes a seniority-driven, point-based lottery process to allocate residential assignments. 
Generally, you gain a point with each successive year (e.g., freshmen have 1 point, sophomores have 2 points, etc.)

There are a variety of housing options available on campus, including singles, doubles, apartment style doubles/triples/quads, and 4-person/6-person suites. When applying as a group, your group average is used throughout the housing lottery. 

This introduces a level of uncertainty for students, as they never really know which rooms are reasonable to apply for. This year in particular, a decrease in approval to live off-campus resulted in a shortage of beds, leaving many students unsure of their housing plans for the 2022-2023 academic school year. To provide some numerical examples, two thousand students applied for the four-person and subsequent two-peron apartment lottery, which only had 800 available beds. This resulted in some students losing the right to live in dorms on campus they currently live in (which is where the idea for Soba was born!). In addition, many students entered lotteries in the four-person and two-person apartment process despite winning an apartment in the three-person process since the students were not aware of the competitive nature of the processes they were about to enter. 

This project attempts to bring some transparency to the housing process with the power of statistics! It allows rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors to get a closer look at all of the housing options, the true amount of beds available, and what their peers and upperclassmen are considering for housing. After all, this is a highly peer-driven process (since your chances at getting a specific room are determined by your seniority and then random selection). 

Why are we doing this? We realized from first-hand experience how much of a headache our current housing process is for both students and administration. By implementing a system like Soba, we're hopeful that students will have the access to proper and complete information from themselves and their peers, limiting the work administration has to do in the form of maintaining a housing waitlist, working through students rejecting apartments, and dealing with the aftermath of a crazy housing cycle.

We hope you enjoy our project! For additional information about the Vanderbilt Housing Process, please visit [our housing documentation](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/ohare/)
